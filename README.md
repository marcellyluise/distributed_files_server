# distributed_files_server
This is a project from the discipline Computer Network at the University of Brasilia. 
This server should provider web access to a distributed files system by a set of clients and servers in a local network. 

The app main file is controlador.js.
Trying some mvc here: folder vw contains interface and mod process things.

A requirement from the discipline is no framework use. So we have to find a way to organize our code.
